//Cast of characters:
//Luke Stone is a white MI6 spy that has ADHD and is bisexual. He has not come out to anyone at the organisation. The only one who knows is Ms. Burke and that's because she has known his family since he was young
//Lauren Campbell is one of the rare agents at MI6 who believe in justice and has exposed the former chief Mark Bulbie of being a peadophile. Because of that, she was suspended but was reinstated by Ms. Burke just before you went on your last mission with her 8 months ago. She is a potential partner for the mission Ms Burke gives you and can be romanced. She is very prepared and is very good at the skill of quickchange and will be useful if you get in trouble. 
//Ben Stevens is one of the openly gay workers at MI6. He works at the R & D department where he makes the gadgets for your mission. He's also autistic so he is someone that understands what it is like navigating a neurotypical world while having an aneurotypical mind. He is a potential partner for the mission Ms. Burke gives you and can be romanced
//Erik Georgiy is a hacker and whistleblower who has a hatred for organisations like MI5/MI6 because of their hypocrisy in letting their agents kill and torture people without prosecution. He is different from a typical hacker because he does not brag about his hacks like the average Hollywood hacker.
<u>Chapter 1</u>
Your name is Luke Stone. 
You work for MI6.
You are waiting for the chief to call you in for a meeting.
*You remember your last mission.

===your_last_mission===
FEBRUARY 10TH 2019 - EIGHT MONTHS AGO 
PARIS
11AM
You are watching your target with another field agent, Lauren Campbell.
LUKE: How much longer is he going to sit there?
Lauren shrugs.
LAUREN: Until he leaves.
You fold your arms and sigh.
*LUKE: How do we pass the time until then?
->pass_the_time
*LUKE: Why is fieldwork so bloody boring?
->boring_work
*LUKE: Why are we here again?
->information_on_target
===pass_the_time===
LAUREN: Let's talk about things that happened to us at work.
LUKE: You want to talk about work?
LAUREN: Yeah? Why not?
LUKE: Alright. How has work been for you lately? How does it feel not being suspended anymore?
LAUREN: Good. It's nice to be able to go on missions again. 
*LUKE: That was really brave what you did.
->brave_what_you_did
*LUKE: You were revealed as a whistleblower. That couldn't have been easy.
->revealed_as_whistleblower
*LUKE: Work has been good for me too.
->work_has_been_good_for_me
===brave_what_you_did===
Lauren looks down with a small smile on her face.
LUKE: I'm serious. I wouldn't have the guts to expose the chief as a peadophile. How did you do it? Why did you do it?
LAUREN: MI6 is supposed to stop criminals but yet, everyone that knew about Bulbie swept it under the rug. Everyone was so worried about what the press would think so I did a little independent digging. 
*LUKE: Independent digging?
->how_lauren_exposed_peadophile
===how_lauren_exposed_peadophile===
LAUREN: Bulbie was so shit with computers. He didn't know that websites in incognito mode still show up on the network. Eventually, I found a log of all his disgusting wanking material and sent it to SecureDrop.
LUKE: SecureDrop is connected to the Tor Browser right? Isn't that stuff supposed to be anonymous? How did you get caught?
LAUREN: I forgot about MI6's keyloggers. They tracked everything I did. In the end, I didn't care about getting caught. I just wanted that disgusting cunt out of MI6.
LUKE: You didn't expose him to try and get a promotion or anything. That just proves you're one of, if not, the best agents at MI6 I know.
Lauren grins at you. She pulls out her fist and you bump yours against hers.
*You see sudden movement in front of you. Your target is finally moving.
->sudden_movement
===revealed_as_whistleblower===
LAUREN: Of course it wasn't easy. I didn't care about that. He deserved to be exposed.
LUKE: I know. I just wanted to know why you did it. Was it worth getting suspended?
Lauren glares at you and takes a deep breath.
LAUREN: I knew I would get suspended. I just couldn't get over how hypocritical the organisation was. Their slogan is "Make the UK a safer place" while they had a chief that jerked off to little girls. What a fucking lie. I knew that MI6 was shady but I didn't think they would hide disgusting shit like that. They're always on about "diversity and equality" but then they treat their Black workers like shit when they do the right thing. What a bunch of pussyclarts! 
*LUKE: Yeah, I agree with you.
->agree_with_lauren
*LUKE: Why don't you just quit this job?
->ask_lauren_about_quitting_mi6lastmission
*LUKE: What is a pussyclart exactly?
->pussyclart
===agree_with_lauren===
LAUREN: I'm glad you do.
LUKE: MI6 can definitely do better in the way they treat you and the other Black workers. They really should have handled that situation better instead of hiding. 
LAUREN: Yep.
LUKE: At least everyone is treating you better now. Ms. Burke got you reinstated as a field agent and now you're here with me.
LAUREN: Yeah, at least there's that. Thank God she's the new chief. 
She smirks at you.
LAUREN: Let's keep me badmouthing MI6 to ourselves. 
You snort at that.
LUKE: It's just between us.
*You see sudden movement in front of you. Your target is finally moving.
->sudden_movement
===ask_lauren_about_quitting_mi6lastmission===
LAUREN: I can't just quit and find another job that easily. 
LUKE: It sounds like you're miserable working here. 
LAUREN: I am but I'm not gonna just quit. I need this job to support my family.
LUKE: Sorry. I shouldn't have brought that up. 
LAUREN: It's fine. Besides, ever since I got rid of Bulbie, I feel like I made a difference to MI6. I've made them less corrupt. 
LUKE: That's good. I'm glad you're enjoying your job better now.
LAUREN: Yeah. Me too. 
*You see sudden movement in front of you. Your target is finally moving.
->sudden_movement
===pussyclart===
Lauren laughs at this question. 
LAUREN: Seriously? It's right there in the word. <b>Pussy</b>. Clart. I'm calling them pussies.
LUKE: Oh. Right. What type of slang is that?
LAUREN: It's patois Luke. That means it's Jamaican. It's also a big part of London slang.
LUKE: Oh. That's good to know.
Lauren snorts again.
LAUREN: Do you mean that or are you just saying that?
*LUKE: I mean it. I'm interested to know more about where you come from. 
->interested_about_laurens_culture
*LUKE: I'm just saying it.
->uninterested_about_laurens_culture
===interested_about_laurens_culture===
LUKE: You know where I come from, being from London but I don't know a lot about you.
Lauren smiles at that. 
LAUREN: I moved from Montego Bay to London when I was about 5. 
LUKE: Montego Bay? Where is that?
LAUREN: In Jamaica. So I grew up in Lewisham with my sister Jackie and our parents. 
LUKE: Do you remember Jamaica from when you were younger?
LAUREN: Yeah. I remember it. There are some days where I would love to leave London and go back there but for now, my life is in the UK.
*LUKE: Thank you for telling me about your childhood. 
->gladlaurentoldyouaboutchildhood
*LUKE: Tell me more about your family.
->asklaurenaboutfamily
===uninterested_about_laurens_culture===
Lauren rolls her eyes.
LAUREN: Yeah, I knew you weren't interested. 
LUKE: Sorry. I was just trying to move on with the conversation. 
LAUREN: Yeah. I know. Let's just focus on the mission now.
LUKE: Okay.
*You see sudden movement in front of you. Your target is finally moving.
->sudden_movement
===asklaurenaboutfamily===
LAUREN: My parents are very hardworking. Dad's a mechanic and mum is a nurse. Growing up, they were very supportive of my career. Obviously, they don't know I'm a spy.
LUKE: What do they think you do?
LAUREN: They know that I work for MI6 but they think that I'm a business analyst. I couldn't tell them that I'm a spy. I wouldn't want to worry them. Do your parents know about your job?
LUKE: Not really. My mother's dead and I don't have much of a relationship with my father.
LAUREN: Oh. I'm sorry Luke. I didnt know. I wasn't trying to bring up bad memories or anything.
LUKE: It's fine. I don't think a lot about my dad anyway. It was 10 years ago my mum died and I still miss her.
She takes your hand and squeezes it tightly.
LUKE: Thank you Lauren. 
*You see sudden movement in front of you. Your target is finally moving.
->sudden_movement
===gladlaurentoldyouaboutchildhood===
LAUREN: I'm happy you asked. It was a good conversation.
LUKE: It was. I feel like I know you better now.
She beams at you. 
*You see sudden movement in front of you. Your target is finally moving.
->sudden_movement
===work_has_been_good_for_me===
LAUREN: Oh yeah?
LUKE: Yeah. Dealing with the ADHD has gotten a bit easier. The coach I'm seeing is helping me through the bad days.
She smiles.
LAUREN: That's great.
LUKE: I'm also happy that Ms. Burke assigned us on the field together.
She grins at you.
LAUREN: Most of the people at MI6 are dickheads but I'm glad I have you.
You two bump fists.
*You see sudden movement in front of you. Your target is finally moving.
->sudden_movement
===boring_work===
LAUREN: Becuase that's what field work is. Being on the field is boring. You know this. Did you take your medication?
LUKE: I forgot to take my Ritalin this morning.
LAUREN: What made you forget?
LUKE: This is my first mission after being diagnosed. I never needed them before. I'll be fine. Don't worry about me.
Lauren gives you a look of disbelief.
LAUREN: If you say so.
*You see sudden movement in front of you. Your target is finally moving.
->sudden_movement
===information_on_target===
LAUREN: Seriously? You've forgotten why we're here?
LUKE: Yeah. I remember that our target is a human trafficker and we have all the information we need on him. What I've forgotten is why we're staked out here.
She gives you an understanding look.
LAUREN: It's the ADHD, right?
LUKE: Yeah. I forgot to take my meds before doing this.
LAUREN: MI6 wants us to take him in after we've found information. Since we've collected the information, now's the part when we take him in.
LUKE: Thanks for explaining it to me. 
LAUREN: It's fine. I know it's not your fault. Just try and prepare better for next time.
LUKE: I'll try.
*You see sudden movement in front of you. The human trafficker is finally moving.
->sudden_movement
===sudden_movement===
LUKE: Oh finally. Let's go
Lauren starts the engine and goes after the target.
As you reach the target, you see him get out of his vehicle running away from you.  
*[Get out of vehicle and chase after him.]
->chase_target
===chase_target===
You get out of the car and chase after the target.
LAUREN: Hey! What are you doing?
LUKE: I have to catch him.
LAUREN: Do it fast and quietly. You don't want to cause a scene. 
You chase the target into an alleyway and as he makes his way to climb over a fence, you pull out your pistol.
*[Take target out fast.]
->take_target_out_fast
*[Take target out quietly.]
->take_target_out_quietly
===take_target_out_fast===
You shoot him three times in the back and he falls over backwards. As you approach him, you see him bleeding out very fast with no way of recovering before you can call for help. Before you know it, his eyes stare out into space. He's dead.
LUKE: Lauren, I'm in the alleyway in front of you. Get over here now.
Lauren comes over and gets out of the car. She sees the dead body.
LAUREN: Shit, you killed him?
LUKE: You said to do it fast.
LAUREN: I didn't mean you should kill him Luke! {boring_work or information_on_target: Why couldn't you have just taken your medication this morning?}
You have never seen Lauren this angry at you before. 
LUKE: I'm sorry Lauren. I didn't know what else to do.
LAUREN: I know but I  have to report this to Ms. Burke. I'm sorry Luke but you're going to get suspended for this.
*[Back to present day.]
->chief_calls_you_into_office
===take_target_out_quietly===
You shoot the ground to scare him. You then catch up to him and grab him away from the fence. You wrestle him to the ground and handcuff him to prevent him from escaping.
{information_on_target: HUMAN TRAFFICKER|TARGET}: Who are you?!
You ignore him and call Lauren.
LUKE: Lauren, I'm in the alleyway in front of you. I've cuffed him so you need to get here ASAP.
Lauren comes over and sees the target on the ground. 
LAUREN: Thank goodness you took him out quietly. 
She takes out her phone.
LAUREN: I'll call Ms. Burke and tell her the mission was a success.
*[Back to present day.]
->chief_calls_you_into_office
===chief_calls_you_into_office===
{take_target_out_fast: You always hated thinking back to that painful day.} At last, the chief calls you into her office. As you enter, you wonder why Ms. Burke wanted to talk to you as you haven't done fieldwork in 8 months.
MS. BURKE: Good morning Mr. Stone.
LUKE: Good morning Ms. Burke.
MS. BURKE: I suppose you're wondering why I appointed you into my office.
*LUKE: The thought had crossed my mind.
->thought_crossed_mind
*LUKE: The thought never crossed my mind.
->thought_never_crossed_mind
*LUKE: How was your day Ms. Burke?
->ask_ms_burke_about_day
===thought_crossed_mind===
Ms. Burke smiles at that.
MS. BURKE: I called you in here to talk about fieldwork.
 { take_target_out_fast: 
   LUKE: Fieldwork? But I'm suspended.
   MS. BURKE: What if I lifted your suspension? 
*LUKE: I would like that.
->would_like_suspension_lifted
*LUKE: I don't know.
->dont_know_suspension_lifted
}
{ take_target_out_quietly:
  LUKE: Are you going to tell me why I haven't been on a mission for so long? I did well on my last mission.
  MS. BURKE: Yes you did. However, you failed to tell me that you didn't take your medication before catching the target. You knew you were supposed to take them 3 times a day. Why would you go against our doctors' instructions?
  *LUKE: No one else has to do this.
  ->no_one_else
}
===would_like_suspension_lifted===
MS. BURKE: Good. Now that you've agreed, I can give you the mission brief. Are you ready for it?
LUKE: Yes, Ms. Burke. I'm ready.
->mission_brief
===dont_know_suspension_lifted===
MS. BURKE: Think about it Mr. Stone. Don't you get bored having to do desk work all day? Wouldn't you feel better on the field?
You would feel better on the field but you didn't want what happened last time to happen again.
LUKE: What if I mess up again?
MS. BURKE: You won't. In fact, I'll make sure of it by checking up on you every day. I'll make sure what happened in Paris won't happen again. Understand Mr. Stone? 
LUKE: Yes, Ms. Burke. I understand. 
MS. BURKE: Good, now I can give you the mission brief. 
*LUKE: Let's hear it.
->mission_brief
===no_one_else===
MS. BURKE: You're not the only neurodivergent agent here. 
LUKE: Yes but I got diagnosed a year ago. The executive dysfunction is getting a little better on some days but that's because of the ADHD coach you got.
MS. BURKE: I'm glad the ADHD coach is helping you. But you need to talk to more people about this. Maybe try talking to the other neurodivergent agents.
*LUKE: I can try and do that. 
->try_talk_to_other_neurodivergent_agents
*LUKE: I don't need to talk to anyone else.
->dont_need_to_talk_anyoneelse
*LUKE: Can we just talk about the mission please?
->mission_brief
===try_talk_to_other_neurodivergent_agents===
MS. BURKE: Good. That's all I ask.
LUKE: Are there other agents with ADHD?
MS. BURKE: Yes there are. You know this organisation loves to find ordinary people with extraordinary minds and skills.
LUKE: And that includes me?
MS. BURKE: Of course.
LUKE: So do you know who these other agents are?
MS. BURKE: That's something you have to find out on your own. Now, are you ready to hear about the mission?
*LUKE: I'm ready. Explain what the mission is.
->mission_brief
===dont_need_to_talk_anyoneelse===
MS. BURKE: I think it would be good if you did talk to someone about this.
LUKE: I already talk to Lauren about it and I don't have much friends here anyway.
MS. BURKE: I know Luke. But you could really benefit yourself by making more friends here and opening up to more people.
LUKE: I'd rather not. I don't really feel comfortable telling people about it.
Ms. Burke sighs in disappointment.
MS. BURKE: Okay. I won't force you to do something you're not comfortable with.
*LUKE: Thank you. Can you explain what the mission is?
->mission_brief
===thought_never_crossed_mind===
Ms. Burke doesn't look convinced by this statement.
MS. BURKE: This is the first time we've spoken in months. You're really saying you didn't have a single thought as to why I called you in here?
You shrug. 
MS. BURKE: You're lucky I've known you since you were a boy. Let's move on.
MS. BURKE: I called you in here because I think now is the perfect time for you to go on another mission.
{ take_target_out_fast: 
   LUKE: Another mission? I'm suspended because I fucked up the last mission. Why do you want me to go on another mission?
   MS. BURKE: Because I think you need it. Don't you want me to lift your suspension?
*LUKE: I would like that.
->would_like_suspension_lifted
*LUKE: I don't know.
->dont_know_suspension_lifted
}
{ take_target_out_quietly:
  LUKE: Are you going to tell me why I haven't been on a mission for so long? I did well on my last mission.
  MS. BURKE: Yes you did. However, you failed to tell me that you didn't take your medication before taking out the target. You know you're supposed to take them everyday. Why would you go against our doctors' instructions?
  *LUKE: No one else has to do this.
  ->no_one_else
}
===ask_ms_burke_about_day===
MS. BURKE: My day was good. Thanks for asking. How is your day?
*LUKE: It's fine.

*LUKE: It was fine until I got called in.
->day_was_fine
===day_is_fine===
MS. BURKE: That's good to hear. Is the ADHD coach helping with the executive dysfunction?
LUKE: Some days are better than others but their tips have been mostly helpful. How are things going with you and the divorce?
MS. BURKE: I didn't call you in here to talk about my private life. We're here about you. How would you feel about going back on the field?
 { take_target_out_fast: 
   LUKE: But I'm suspended.
   MS. BURKE: What if I lifted your suspension? 
*LUKE: I would like that.

  MS. BURKE: Yes you did. However, you failed to tell me that you didn't take your medication before taking out the target. You know you're supposed to take them everyday. Why would you go against the MI6 doctors' instructions?
  *LUKE: No one else has to do this.
  ->no_one_else
}
===day_was_fine===
MS. BURKE: I know a meeting like this must be stressful for you but I bought you here for a good reason.
LUKE: What's the reason?
 { take_target_out_fast: 
   MS. BURKE: What if I lifted your suspension if you prove you can do a mission for me?
   LUKE: Another mission? I don't know how to feel about that after the last mission but the thought about you lifting my suspension...
*Makes me happy.
->would_like_suspension_lifted
*Makes me uneasy.
->dont_know_suspension_lifted
}
{take_target_out_quietly:
MS. BURKE: How would you feel about going on a field mission?
LUKE: I would love that. Why haven't you assigned me on a mission since February?
MS. BURKE: Because you failed to tell me that you didn't take your medication before taking out the target. You know you're supposed to take them everyday. Why would you go against the MI6 doctors' instructions?
*LUKE: No one else has to do this.
  ->no_one_else
}
===mission_brief===
MS. BURKE: You know about the hacker named Erik Georgiy?
LUKE: No. What does he have to do with MI6?
MS. BURKE: In 2017, Mr. Georgiy hacked into MI5's servers and collected a lot of information. Information that would cause us a lot of trouble. We got a lot of bad publicity after Lauren's whistleblowing. We don't need another one, especially one we can't control.
LUKE: I still don't understand what that has to do with MI6.
MS. BURKE: We have intel that he plans to go to Prague in 2 days on holiday. We think he's planning on releasing MI5's data while he's there. Since MI5 agents can't operate abroad, they need to send in a MI6 agent to stop him.
*LUKE: Why would he release the data now?
->two_years_since_hack
===two_years_since_hack===
LUKE: It's been 2 years since the MI5 hack. What would make him want to release the information in October 2019?
MS. BURKE: Last October, Lauren exposed Mark Bulbie for being a peadophile. We believe that he wants to mark the anniversary by releasing even more incriminating data. He has everything: agents' personal details, the chief's personal details, mission logs, every sensitive data they've recorded.
LUKE: And you want me to stop him from leaking their information?
MS. BURKE: Yes.
*LUKE: Does Erik have any other criminal charges apart from hacking?
->erik_other_criminal_charges
*LUKE: Are MI6 agents affected too?
->mi6_agents_affected_hack
===erik_other_criminal_charges===
MS. BURKE: No he doesn't. I know he isn't the type of target you usually go after but the fact that he has agents' private details...
MS. BURKE: That's why I made this meeting informal. If word got out about this, it won't be good for any of us. That's why I need you go on this mission.
*LUKE: I'll go on the mission.
->accept_mission
===mi6_agents_affected_hack===
MS. BURKE: Why do you ask?
LUKE: Wasn't there an incident where spyware was installed on MI6's computers last year? Was that Erik or someone else?
MS. BURKE: We don't know. We tried looking into to it but we didn't come up with anything conclusive. It's possible that was Erik's work too.
LUKE: Great, so my data could possibly be exposed too.
MS. BURKE: Yes, that's why you have to stop Erik from leaking the data he has.
*LUKE: Okay, I'll go on the mission.
->accept_mission
===accept_mission===
MS. BURKE: Good. And if it makes you comfortable, you can go with a partner like last time.
LUKE: Okay. Thank you Ms. Burke. 
As you got up to leave the office, Ms. Burke stops you.
MS. BURKE: Luke, thank you. Please don't share this with anyone else other than the agent going with you.
She looks really vulnerable and is putting a lot of responsibility on you. You didn't want to let her down.
LUKE: I promise I won't.

LAUREN: I swear. Tell me.

{ take_target_out_fast:
  Lauren stares at you in disbelief.
  LAUREN: And she just let you go? Even after you fucked up the last mission?
  LUKE: Yeah, she said she would lift my suspension too. She said no one else knows about Erik's plan and I can't tell a lot of people about this mission.
  LAUREN: So she bent the rules for you? That's the weirdest thing I've heard. 
  LAUREN [mutters under her breath]: Jesus, this place moves too mad sometimes.

  { take_target_out_quietly:
    LAUREN: Really? Nice, you haven't been on a mission for a while now. So when is it?
    LUKE: She said he'll be in Prague in 2 days. I have to get there before him so I need to be in Prague by tomorrow.
    LAUREN: Tomorrow? That's quick. Usually, we get some preparation before we go on a mission.
    LUKE: Yeah but since agents' personal data is on the line, I have to go as soon as possible. I was wondering if you wanted me to come with me?
    LAUREN: This is all coming so fast. I need some time to prepare. Can I get back to you at the end of the day?
    LUKE: Sure.
   Lauren walks into Ms. Burke's office leaving you alone in the hallway. You decide to prepare for the mission.

  LAUREN: I'm here for a meeting with Ms. Burke. What about you?
  LUKE: Same. She gave me a mission to stop a hacker from releasing MI5 {mi6_agents_affected_hack: and MI6} agents personal data.
  { take_target_out_fast:
   LAUREN: Seriously? She just let you on the mission and lifted the suspension?
   LUKE: Yeah. Isn't that great?
   She has a look on her face that tells you it's not great.
   LAUREN: Yeah. Great. 
   LUKE: You could sound more happy for me.
   LAUREN: It is a little weird though. You can call me a hypocrite since I got suspended too 6 months ago but it's still weird.
   LUKE: She said herself that the mission is unusual but she'll do anything to stop agents' personal details getting leaked.
   LAUREN: So when and where do you have to go?
   LUKE: I have to get to Prague by tomorrow since Erik, the hacker will be there in 2 days.
   LAUREN: Tomorrow. Wow that's quick.

   LAUREN: I don't know. I would love to but this is at such short notice. I need to think about it.
   LUKE: Of course.
   Lauren walks into Ms. Burke's office leaving you alone in the hallway. You decide to prepare for the mission.

  LAUREN: Sorry. I'm just surprised to see you here. How was your morning?
  LUKE: It's alright. Yours?
  LAUREN: Same. Why were you called into Ms. Burke's office?
  LUKE: She gave me a mission to stop a hacker from releasing MI5 {mi6_agents_affected_hack: and MI6} agents personal data.
  { take_target_out_fast:
    LAUREN: And she's letting you go? That's mad. I'm happy for you though.
    LUKE [sarcastically]: Wow, thanks. I appreciate your support.
    LAUREN: When are you going? 
    LUKE: Tomorrow because Erik, the hacker will be in Prague in 2 days and I have to get there before him.
    LAUREN: Okay. Wow, that is a lot.
    *LUKE: So do you want to come with me?

  { take_target_out_quietly:
    LAUREN: That's cool. I bet you're miserable just doing desk work all the time.
    LUKE: You have no idea.
    LAUREN: When do you have to go?
    LUKE: Tomorrow. I know it's such at short notice but I have to get there before Erik, the hacker does.
    LAUREN: Okay. Cool, I'll definitely think about it. 
    LUKE: Okay.
     Lauren walks into Ms. Burke's office leaving you alone in the hallway. You decide to prepare for the mission.

  }
  ===collect_gadgets_for_mission===
  You walk to the Research and Development department to collect the gadgets that you will use on the mission. You see Ben Stevens, one of the workers there, on his laptop. You tap his shoulder to get his attention. 
  LUKE: Hi Ben.
  Ben jumps in his seat and turns around to look at you. 
  BEN: Oh! H-hi Luke. You scared me. How are you?
  LUKE: I'm good. You?
  He shrugs.
  BEN: Meh. 
  He scratches his head nervously.
  BEN: Anyway, what are you doing here?
  *LUKE: I'm here to see what gadgets you have available.
  ->here_to_see_gadgets_you_have
  ===here_to_see_gadgets_you_have===
  BEN: Oh sure. Can I ask why you want to see the gadgets?
  LUKE: Don't tell this to anyone but I'm going on an informal mission to Prague to catch Erik Georgiy.
  BEN: Erik? Yeah, I remember his hack into MI5. Is he planning something?
  LUKE: Yeah, according to Ms. Burke, he's planning to release all of the MI5 data when he gets to Prague in 2 days.
  BEN: That's insane. I can't say I'm surprised though, MI5's encryption isn't as great as they think it is. 
  {mi6_agents_affected_hack: 
  LUKE: He also might have MI6 agents data too.
  BEN: What, he might have our data too?! You know if our data ends up released, that's game over for us.
  LUKE: I know. That's why I'm going on the mission to stop him. I'll need your best gadgets for this one.
  }
  LUKE: So where are the gadgets?
  BEN: Here.
  He puts his laptop away and takes out a couple of gadgets to show you. 
  *You pick up a gun fitted with an LED indicator on the bottom.
  ->ben_shows_you_gadgets
  ===ben_shows_you_gadgets===
  LUKE: What type of gun is this?
  BEN: This is what I call the auto-aim gun. 
  He puts his hand over yours to show you its features.
  BEN:It has a switch for lethal mode and non-lethal mode. So this is lethal mode.
  The LED indicator turns red.
  BEN: And this is non-lethal mode.
  The LED indicator turns blue.
  He takes his hand off yours.
  BEN: So, what do you think?
  LUKE: I think you've been playing too many videogames man.
  He snorts and rolls his eyes.
  BEN: Yeah, yeah. Do you like it?
  *LUKE: Yeah, I like it.
  ->you_like_autoaim_gun
  *LUKE: Do you have anything else?
  ->do_you_have_anything_else
  ===you_like_autoaim_gun===
  Ben looks happy that you like it. {take_target_out_fast: You could definitely see how this will be useful to the mission as it could prevent what happened last time from happening again.} He shows you another gadget he has developed. 
  BEN: This is a smartwatch installed with a tracker and a camera so you can easily videocall any agent for help whenever you're in trouble. What do you think of this?
  *LUKE: I like it.
  ->you_like_smartwatch
  *LUKE: Do you have anything else?

  ===do_you_have_anything_else===
  Ben looks slightly disappointed that you didn't like the gun but he shows you another gadget that looks like a smartwatch.

  Ben looks happy that you like the smartwatch. You could see the smartwatch being useful if you misplaced your phone. With your ADHD, that had a likely chance of happening. 
  BEN: So which gadget are you taking with you for the mission?
  *LUKE: I'll take both gadgets.

  Ben looks a little annoyed that you didn't like {do_you_have_anything_else: any of his gadgets.|the smartwatch.}
  BEN: No, I don't have anything else. You need to pick at least one of the gadgets.

  ===take_both_gadgets===
  BEN: Really? Wow, thanks Luke.
  LUKE: Actually, now that you've given me these gadgets, I've thought about the idea of a R & D worker going on a mission with an agent. That usually doesn't happen.
  BEN: Yeah. That's because we don't have any field skills. We can't shoot a gun, can't quick change if we get caught. We're useless on the field.
  LUKE: Not for this mission. There's no one here that's better at hacking than you. If anything, you would be a great asset on the mission.
  BEN: I don't know Luke. I need to think about it for a while.
  LUKE: That's fine. 
  As you turn to leave, Ben calls out to you.
  BEN: Wait, is that the only reason you came here? Can we talk about other things too?

  Ben looks satisfied that you chose the auto-aim gun. His affection for you grows a little because of this.
  LUKE: I've been thinking, since I have this gun, why not just have you come with me to the mission?
  BEN: Um because I don't have any field skills. I'd be better off here in London than going with you.
  LUKE: Think about it Ben. You're great at hacking and the target is a hacker. You'd be really useful if you came with me.
  After a few seconds of silence, he responds.
  BEN: I'll think about it. 
    You nodded at this. As you turned to leave, Ben called out to you.
  BEN: Wait, is that the only reason you came here? Can we talk about other things apart from the mission?

  Ben looks pleased that you chose the smartwatch. His affection for you grows slightly.
  LUKE: Since I have this smartwatch, why don't you come with me to the mission?
  BEN: Um because I'm not a field agent. I won't be any good in Prague.
  LUKE: Of course you will. You're great at hacking and the target I'm after is hacker. It would be really good if you came with me.
  After a few seconds of silence, he responds.

  There was a brief moment of silence as you could not come up with anything to ask him. A minute later, he sighs.
  BEN: Surely there's something you want to talk to me about.

  He shrugs.
  BEN: It's not so bad, I guess. I don't get paid as much as field agents but it's still good pay. The other workers are friendly too, we mostly nerd out when we're not working. Sometimes, we play tabletop games after hours. 
  LUKE: That's cool.
  BEN: Yeah. It's a good job. People usually focus on the field agents but this organisation is about information and you agents wouldn't be able to do your jobs without us. 
  He looks annoyingly smug about that but you couldn't disagree.
  LUKE: That's true. I didn't think about it like that. 
  LUKE: It was good talking to you Ben. Talk to you later?
  BEN: Sure.

  You take a deep breath.
  LUKE: This is the first time I'm telling this to anyone at MI6 so please don't tell anyone else.
  BEN: I won't.
  LUKE: Okay. I'm bisexual.
  You nervously look at Ben's reaction. His eyebrows are raised.
  BEN: Huh, wow. I wasn't expecting that. Thanks for telling me. You definitely won't have to worry about me telling anyone else.
  You sigh in relief.
  LUKE: Thank you so much. So what <em>is</em> it like being openly gay here?
  BEN: I mean, most of the workers are fine with it. I'm not even the only gay R & D worker here at MI6. I'm pretty sure there's loads of agents that are part of the community too.
  LUKE: Really?
  BEN: Yeah. Don't you talk to a lot of the agents here?
  LUKE: Not really. 
  BEN: MI6 was voted as one of the best places to work for the LGBT community so it's not that shocking. I'm surprised you haven't opened up to more people about it.
  He stares at you with a smile on his face until you both hear an alarm go off at his desk.
  BEN: Shit, I have to get back to work. It was good talking to you. Thanks for trusting me with your secret.
  LUKE: No problem. 
  *[Leave to prepare for mission]
  ->prepare_for_mission
  ===curiousity_about_being_openly_gay===
  BEN: Well, most of the workers are fine. A lot of the workers here are gay too. In fact, this place has been voted as one of the most inclusive workplaces for the LGBT community.
  LUKE: Really? 
  BEN: Yeah, you probably wouldn't expect that from MI6 but it's true. They've been really supportive there. 
  LUKE: That's good.
  BEN: Yeah. Anyway, I have to get back to work.
  LUKE: Okay. It was good talking to you.
  BEN: You too. 
  *[Leave to prepare for mission]

  ===ask_ben_about_his_interests===
  BEN: I mostly play a lot of first person shooter games. I'm really into the Metro games. That, along with the Witcher is an example of book to game adaptations done right. Are you into videogames?
  LUKE: I play them casually. I'm not really a fan of multiplayer games. I liked the Witcher games too, especially the Witcher 3.
  BEN: Same! That game is fucking amazing. I had no idea you were into videogames.
  LUKE: Yeah that's because we don't talk a lot. We should definitely change that though.
  Ben smiles at you and nods excitedly like an hyperactive labrador.
  BEN: Definitely! 
  An alarm goes off on his desk.
  BEN: Shit, I have to get back to work now but it was great talking to you. I can't wait to talk more about the Witcher with you.
  LUKE: I can't wait either.

  BEN: Talk to you later, Luke. 
  As you walk back to your desk, you receive an email from Ms. Burke showing the flight schedule for tomorrow. You get out your daily planner and make a plan to take your medication 3 times a day whiie you are in Prague. You also write out a list that reminds you to pack all of your belongings, send the schedule to your partner and set up an alarm to get to the airport early tomorrow morning.
  After that, you think about the two potential partners for the mission: Lauren and Ben. Each have their own strengths. Lauren has experience on the field while Ben is good with gadgets, which would be useful for this mission. Who are you taking on the mission with you?

  You decide to take Lauren with you to the mission. It makes sense as she has been with you on missions before and you could easily work with her. You email her the flight schedule which she acknowledges. You tell Ben that you were taking Lauren and he is very relieved to hear that he didn't have to go on a field mission. 
  *[END OF CHAPTER ONE]

  You decide to take Ben with you to the mission. It makes sense as the target is a hacker and no one knows hacking better at MI6 than Ben. You email him the flight schedule which he acknowledges.

  Lauren shrugs.
  LAUREN: Okay.
  You two watch the movie together quietly. When the movie finishes, you two talk about how it is a very good movie. You both agree that the CGI for Pikachu and the other Pokemon were amazing. After that discussion, you hear the pilot announce that they are arriving in Prague.

  LAUREN: Yes! I've always wanted to watch it but I've never found the time.
  You two watch the movie together, Lauren watching it with a big smile on her face. When the movie finishes, Lauren is chatting animately to you about how that was the perfect ending for the Toy Story series. Although your feelings of the movie were not as strong as hers, you had to agree with her on that.
  After that discussion, you hear the pilot announce that they are arriving in Prague.

  LAUREN: Really? You want to watch that? Okay.
  You two watch the movie together quietly. When the movie finishes, you both agree that the movie was original and charming. Lauren thought the twists that happened in the movie were unexpected and fresh. You secretly thought Hamesh Patel looked quite cute in the movie and was attracted to his singing voice. After that discussion, you hear the pilot announce that they are arriving in Prague.

  LAUREN: Alright. How did you cope with desk work full time?
   LUKE: Honestly, {take_target_out_fast: I know I deserved to be suspended but } at first, desk work felt like a cruel punishment. Simple write up tasks take the whole bloody day, the workers hate it when I walk around and being in that office feels like hell.
   LAUREN: I'm sorry Luke. I had no idea it was that bad. 
   LUKE: Yeah, recently, it hasn't been that bad. Ms. Burke got me to see an ADHD coach. He's been really helpful. {take_target_out_fast: I think the last mission really made me accept that I have a disorder and I needed to get it under control. }
   LAUREN: That's really good Luke. I'm proud of you.
   LUKE: Thanks so how's work going for you?
   LAUREN: It's been good. The mission I went on last month was a little boring. I had to track a poacher in Calais so this mission is a step up.
   LUKE: Do you ever think about when all of this will become obsolete? Do you think Brexit will affect us going to EU countries?
   Lauren shakes her head.
   LAUREN: No. No. No. Please let's not ruin this flight by talking about fucking Brexit. I don't want to think about how it will affect our jobs. 
   LUKE: Yeah, you're right. Let's talk about our interests now. 
   *[Talk about interests]

   ===talk_about_interests_second_with_lauren===
   LAUREN: What do you like doing when you're off work?
   You shrug.
   LUKE: I like playing videogames, watching sci-fi and fantasy shows. The last fantasy show I watched was Game of Thrones and that was a massive disappointment.
   LAUREN: Don't even mention that show in my presence. The way they ended the show by making Bran be the one to sit on the throne made no fucking sense.
   LUKE: To think they did all of that so that they could do Star Wars.
   You shake your head at the way the show ended. You two continue to talk about that show and other shows that had bad endings until you hear the pilot's announcement that they are arriving in Prague.

   LAUREN: The flight is for 2 hours. You won't get that much sleep.
   LUKE: I know but it will be good for me.
   LAUREN: Alright. I'll watch a movie or something.
   As you slept, you dreamt about how the mission with Erik would go. {take_target_out_fast: 
   You have a nightmare of you taking out your gun and shooting him three times. You woke up in fright.
        LAUREN: Woah. Are you okay, Luke?
        You take short breaths.
        LUKE: I-I don't know. I don't think it was a good idea for me to go on this mission. What if I end up shooting Erik too?
        Lauren takes your hand.
        LAUREN: Hey. What happened in Paris won't happen again. You had never been on  a mission with your ADHD. Now you know how to cope. Besides, I will be there to help you calm down and to remind you to take your meds. You don't have to deal with this alone Luke. 
        LUKE: Thanks Lauren. I'm glad you're here with me.
        She smiles at you and lets go of your hand.
        LAUREN: Go back to sleep. I'll wake you up when we land. 
        You went back to sleep with no nightmares.

      {take_target_out_quietly:
      You dream about taking in Erik Georgiy. Everything goes successfully but as you bring him in, he tells you something alarming.
      ERIK: All of your personal data is online. Did you not think that I wouldn't set up a dead man's switch so that no matter what happens, your personal data is out there for the world to see.
      The dreams shifts to you in Ms. Burke's office.
      MS. BURKE: You failed the mission Luke. I have no choice but to fire you.
      You wake up in a panic. 
      LAUREN: What's wrong?
      You take short breaths.
      LUKE: We have to be careful with this guy, Erik. What if he sets up a dead man's switch so that no matter what, the data is leaked anyway?
      LAUREN: I thought about that already. That's why when we catch him, we go through all of his devices and disable the switch. If we can't do it ourselves, we make him do it.
      LUKE: You're right. Huh, I guess I was worrying over nothing. 
      LAUREN: You should go back to sleep. I'll wake you up when we land.
      You went back to sleep and slept well.

  LUKE: I know. Sorry if that bothered you.
  LAUREN: It didn't. Anyway, we're in Prague now.

  The plane was beginning to land on the runway of Václav Havel Airport Prague. Once it landed, you and Lauren go and get a taxi in order to get to the hotel. As you two get to the hotel room, you see that there is only one bed in the bedroom. How are you and Lauren going to sort this out?

  You want to leave the hotel room and see what Prague has to offer. It would be fun if Lauren chooses to come with you.
  LUKE: Hey, I was wondering if you wanted to go sightseeing with me. We're only here for a little while and since Erik will be here tomorrow, we might as well just spend today having fun.
  Lauren smiles at this.
  LAUREN: Yeah, you're right. We should have a little fun. We barely got to do anything in Paris except for the mission so doing this should be interesting.
  LUKE: Great.
  LAUREN: Wait. How many times have you taken your medication today?
  LUKE: Once. Before we got on the plane.
  LAUREN: You should take it again now.
  You grab another Ritalin and swallow it down.

  Lauren frowns at this.
  LAUREN: I don't know Luke. I had a plan of us going to a club but now that I'm here, I don't feel like going. I just want to stay inside.
  LUKE: Wait, which club?
  LAUREN: Roxy. I booked us to go and see this punk rock band but I don't feel like going. Here's your ticket.

  LAUREN: Last night. I thought it would be a fun thing to do but I think I have a bit of jet lag. It wouldn't be good for the mission.
  You struggle to believe what she just said. Who gets jet lag from a 2 hour flight?
  LUKE: You sure this is from jet lag?
  LAUREN: Yeah Luke. I just want to stay in here and focus on the mission.
  You didn't fight with her but you didn't want to go to the club by yourself.
  LUKE: I have to give this back to you. Clubbing isn't really my thing.
  LAUREN: That's fine. 
  LUKE: I won't be out for too long.

  LUKE: Why?
  LAUREN: It's stupid. I guess I just don't expect to hear a white guy say their favourite rapper is Frank Ocean.

  As you leave the hotel with Lauren and walk the streets of Prague together, you look up the top tourist attractions in Prague. The attractions that pop out to you are:
  <ul>
  <li>The Charles Bridge, which is seen as one of the most romantic places in Prague.</li>
  <li>The Klementinum Library, one of the most beautiful libraries in the world.</li>
  </ul>
  You decided to go to:

  LUKE: Let's go to the Klementinum Library.
  Lauren looks at you in disbelief.
  LAUREN: We have the choice to go anywhere we want and you choose to go to the library?
  LUKE: People say it's the most beautiful libraries they've seen.
  LAUREN: Alright fine. I'll go to this library with you. It better be as great as they say it is. 
  LUKE: I'm sure you'll like it. 
  When you two get to the library, you couldn't help but gasp in awe at how massive it is. You knew it was big but seeing it in person was different.
  Lauren also gasps.
  LAUREN: Woah. This place is huge. It reminds me of the library from Game of Thrones.
  As you two walk around trying to find a section to observe, Lauren notices the non-fiction section. 
  LAUREN: Let's see what they have there.
  *[Follow Lauren]
  ->follow_lauren_in_library
  ===follow_lauren_in_library===
  You follow her to that section and she has her eyes on a book that has Edward Snowden's face on it. Permanent Record.
  LUKE: Of course you would pick a book like that.
  LAUREN: What? I think this type of information is interesting.
  You wondered if another reason she likes it is that it helps her justify exposing Bulbie. 
  {brave_what_you_did or revealed_as_whistleblower: 
  LUKE: I think what you did was a good thing.
  LAUREN: I know. You said so on the last mission.
  LUKE: I know. I just don't want you think that I'm judging you for reading a Edward Snowden book. 
  She snickered at you.
  LAUREN: I know. The reason whistleblowers whistleblow in the first place is to right wrongs done in an organisation. I did that with MI6.
  LUKE: What do you think about what Erik plans to do? You could call that whistleblowing.
  LAUREN: There's a difference between what I did and what he's going to do. I exposed someone for doing something vile. He's affecting everyone who works at MI5 and MI6 by exposing personal data. You can't compare it. 
  LUKE: You're right. It's not the same. I was just wondering what if he sees it that way? MI5 and MI6 have done illegal things and the people that work there have to pay.
  LAUREN: We can't compromise the mission by thinking about this from his point of view. No matter how you rationalise it, what he's doing is immoral and he has to be stopped.
  LUKE: You're right. Do you want to check the book out?
  Lauren glances at the book and puts it back on the shelf. 
  LAUREN: Eh. We're only here for a few days. I'll buy it when we get back to London. Is there a book you wanted to check out? 
  LUKE: Not really. I just wanted to come have a look at the place. We should go back to the hotel.
  LAUREN: Yeah. Actually, before we go back, I bought us tickets to see a band at a club tonight.
  LUKE: A band at a club? Why didn't you mention this sooner?
  LAUREN: It honestly slipped my mind. I know I should have told you sooner. So do you want to go the club?

  LAUREN: Everyday. I don't regret what I did. The reason whistleblowers whistleblow in the first place is to right wrongs done in an organisation. I did that with MI6.
  LUKE: What do you think about what Erik plans to do? Would you call that whistleblowing?

  She looks pensive.
  LAUREN: If you are actually asking me out on a date, what do you expect out of this? Are we going to call each other boyfriend and girlfriend?
  LUKE: Yes. That is what going on a romantic date would entail if it goes successfully.

  LUKE [in awe]: I know.
  LAUREN: I'm glad you took me out here as a friend. It would have been really awkward if this was a romantic date.

  LAUREN: Yeah. Do you want to have even more fun tonight?

   You stop kicking him. As you go back to Lauren, you see all the other clubbers' eyes on you. They have their phones out, no doubt, recording what is happening.

   The bouncer approaches the scene and sees the man on the floor.

   A clubber points at you. The bouncer then escorts you and Lauren out of the club.

  LUKE: And it would be a bad idea to get drunk on a mission.
  LAUREN: That's true.

  She grins at that.

  She gives you a quick peck on the lips.

  LAUREN: No one has ever said those things about me before. Thank you.
  You give her a beaming smile. She returns it.

  LUKE: I just made a plan to catch Erik. Come and see.
  LAUREN: Wow, that looks pretty detailed.
  She presses her lips to yours in a reckless manner. You pick her up, throw her on the bed and return her kisses just as passionately. She begins to undress herself and gestures at you to do the same. It feels like the most pleasant thing in the world, your hands caressing her curly hair while she moans in pleasure.

  LUKE: The reason I joined MI6 is, well, because of Ms. Burke. 
  LAUREN: Ms. Burke? Is that why she gave you this mission? Because she gave you the job?
  LUKE: I've known her almost my whole life. She was close with my parents, especially my mother. 
  {asklaurenaboutfamily: 
  LAUREN: You said in Paris that your mother died.
  }
  You take a deep breath. Talking about this was difficult.
  LUKE: My mum got into a car accident and she didn't make it.
  LAUREN: I'm so sorry Luke. 
  LUKE: I didn't have a close relationship with my father and we got into a lot of arguments. One argument got so intense that he kicked me out. He couldn't cope with Mum's death and he didn't want me around. 
  LAUREN: That's awful. If I may ask, what type of arguments did you two have that made him kick you out?

  You nod.
  LUKE: I'm guessing your dad couldn't understand that.
  You could only nod at that too. Talking about your dad was very difficult for you.
  LUKE: Ms. Burke let me stay with her after that. She saw that I didn't have a job and wanted me to apply to MI6. I'm glad she did because I don't think I could do another job. 
  
  {follow_lauren_in_library or back_to_hotel_without_lauren or charles_bridge_as_friends_lauren: Lauren gets up from the bed and hugs you for a while before finally letting go. }

  You were shocked but happy by her reaction.
  LUKE: You're not bothered by that? A lot of women are usually bothered by that.
  Lauren scoffs.
  LAUREN: Those women are trash. Besides, my sister Jackie is gay and I had to see her hide a part of herself from my homophobic parents. It was so hard on her. I can't imagine what it must have been like for you. 
  She takes your hand.
  LAUREN: I'm glad you told me this. I'm the first person you've told at MI6 right? 
  LUKE: You're the first person I've told. Ms. Burke figured it out. That's why she let me stay with her and became a mentor to me. She saw that I didn't have a job and pushed me to apply for the MI6. I owe her so much.

  LAUREN: So you're on this mission because of nepotism? 
  You wince at that but you nod.
  LAUREN: That explains why she gave you this mission. There's no one else she trusts more than you. 
  LUKE: Yeah, that's why I can't let her down {take_target_out_fast: again}.

  LUKE: What made you join MI6?
  She looks up in thought.
  LAUREN: Well, honestly, at first, it was because of the money. But after I got hired, I started to want to make the UK better. But after the whole Bulbie thing, I've been disillusioned by the organisation for a while.
  LUKE: So why-
  LAUREN: It's not easy to just leave and find another job. I need this job to support my family. My sister's having trouble finding a job. I'm the only one that can support her. 
  LUKE: You're a great sister.
  She smiles widely at you.

   LUKE: I know. I should have just let her handle it.
   MS. BURKE: Yes you should have. Now the police are after you.
   LUKE: What should I do?
   MS. BURKE: Try and avoid them as best as you can. If they do see you, they'll probably just ask for a fine.

   LUKE: He wouldn't leave Lauren alone and I wanted to defend her. 
   MS. BURKE: It's admirable that you want to defend Lauren from harrassment but violence isn't the answer. Look at what it's caused.
   LUKE: What do you suggest I do to fix this?

  LUKE: No. I'll take it now.

  LUKE: I've played Witcher 3 too. It's an amazing game isn't it?

  BEN: The show jumped the shark after season 6. Cersei blowing up the Sept was the last time the show was high in quality.
  You hold out your fist. Ben snorts at this before bumping it.
  LUKE: I can't believe they rushed it all to film Star Wars. 
  BEN: I can. Those guys are very privileged. Like Goldman Sachs privileged. Hollywood caters to guys like them.

  LUKE: Did you overstress yourself a lot?
  He looks as you as if he's saying, <em>are you that naive?</em>
  BEN: It's freelance. Of course I did. Overworked and underpaid.
  LUKE: I'm glad you're in a better position now.

  LUKE: So Erik Georgiy is an alias?
  BEN: Yes. What I did find though is the hotel he'll be staying at: the Old Prague House which is about 20 minutes away from our hotel. 
  LUKE: Nice. How did you find out his hotel?
  BEN: Remember the spyware incident last year?

  As you two walk the streets of Prague, you two stop to decide where to go.

  You look up the top tourist attractions in Prague. The attractions that pop out to you are:
  <ul>
  <li>The Charles Bridge, which is seen as one of the most romantic places in Prague.</li>
  <li>The Klementinum Library, one of the most beautiful libraries in the world.</li>
  <li>RIX, a popular gay nightclub in Prague.</li>
  </ul>
  However, you did not feel comfortable going to RIX as you had never been to a gay nightclub before. You don't think Ben would enjoy going either. You decide to ask him later. For now, you have a choice to make. 
  You decide to go to:

  *[The Klementinum Library]

  ===gotoklementinumlibrarywithben===

  LUKE: Yeah. It's supposed to be one of the biggest libraries in the world.
  Ben's eyebrows raise at that statement.
  BEN: Really? That sounds interesting.
  LUKE: So do you want to go and see it?
  BEN: Yeah. I very much do. Let's go. 
  When you two get to the library, you couldn't help but gasp in awe at how massive it is. You knew it was big but seeing it in person was different.
  Ben also gasps.
  BEN: You were serious about this place being the hugest library in the world. It's like I'm in the Citadel from Game of Thrones. 
  As you two walk around trying to find a section to observe, Ben notices the non-fiction section. 
  BEN: This section looks interesting. Let's see what's there.

  BEN: It's not the same. Erik is threatening to expose people's private data. People who probably have no idea about what unethical things MI5 get up to. Those people don't deserve to have their lives ruined.

  LUKE: No, it's fine. I never wanted to go by myself anyway. Honestly, I've never even been to a gay club before.
  BEN: Oh. Then why did you ask me? I'm a nerd. I hate clubbing.
  LUKE: Honestly? I don't know. It wasn't a wise decision. Let's go back to the hotel.

  ===arriveatrix===
  You two arrive at Rix, hand in hand, and the first thing you notice is the amount of people that are here. You didn't realise the place would be this popular.
  LUKE: Is this a little overwhelming for you?
  He sucks in a big breath. 
  BEN: A little but I'm sure I can handle it.
  LUKE: Okay.
  As you two head to the bar, he stops you.
  BEN: Luke, I don't drink alcohol.

  LUKE: That's fine. I'll tell the bartender that you don't drink.
  BEN: Okay. Thank you.
  You two approach the bartender who asks you what you want to drink.
  *LUKE: I'll have a beer please. My boyfriend here doesn't drink.

  BEN: Really?
  LUKE: Yeah. I don't want you to feel pressured to drink. If it makes you feel better, I can get a non-alcoholic drink.
  He looks relieved.
  BEN: Yeah that would make me feel better. Thank you.
  LUKE: Of course.
  You two share a quick kiss before approaching the bartender who asks you what you want to drink.

  The bartender nods his head and looks at Ben.
  BARTENDER: That's fine. You don't have to drink if you don't want to.
  Ben nods and looks down.
  BARTENDER: Alright. One beer coming up.
  While the bartender prepares your beer, you lean into Ben's ear.
  LUKE: How are you feeling right now?
  BEN: I'm, uh, feeling okay. I never thought I'd be at a nightclub. 
  He grabs your hand.
  BEN: I'm just glad I'm here with you.
  LUKE: I'm glad I'm here with you too. 
  You two share another kiss before the bartender gives you your beer. As you drink it, Ben looks uncomfortable and gets his phone out to distract himself. After finishing the beer, Ben puts his phone away.
  You hear the music change and there is now a slow song playing over the speakers.

  LUKE: I want to know.
  BEN: They weren't great. Then again, what do you expect from Grindr? 
  LUKE: Yeah, I've noticed the people on that app are terrible. How long was your last hookup?
  BEN: It was one hookup and he was very ableist. Kept making fun of my autism.
  {not tell_ben_about_adhd: 
  LUKE: Wait. You're autistic? I have ADHD.
  {tell_ben_you_forgot_something or check_daily_planner: BEN: So that's what the medication is for. }

  BEN: Okay. 
  *[Go to bathroom]

  ===askbenifhesdatedanyoneatmi6===
  He nods his head. 
  BEN: I've dated a few people at MI6. Some of them were agents.
 LUKE: Really?
  BEN: Yeah. You know the agent Nathan Roberts? The tall ginger that's really annoying.
  LUKE: I had no idea he was gay. You went out with him?
  BEN: Yeah. At first I really liked him but as I got to know him, I realised that the guy never shuts up. I swear he loved the sound of his voice. 
  LUKE: So you broke up with him because of that?
  BEN: Nah. I broke up with him because he's a Tory. We broke up 2 months ago. Now its just awkward seeing him at work.
  LUKE: How can a gay person be a Tory? That sounds contradictive as hell.
  BEN: I know! It makes no sense. 
  LUKE: Anyway, I have to go to the bathroom now. I'll be back in a bit. 
  BEN: Okay. 
  *[Go to bathroom]

  ===askbenwhatheexpectsofrelationship===
  BEN: Don't you think it's a little too early to discuss something like that? Can't we just wait to see how tonight goes?
  LUKE: Yeah, you're right. Let's see how tonight goes.
  BEN: If our relationship is like it is tonight, then I hope for a long time.
  He grins at you and you can't help but grin back.
  LUKE: Yeah. Me too.
  You two share a quick kiss.
  LUKE: I have to go to the bathroom now. I'll be back in a bit.
  BEN: Okay. 
  *[Go to bathroom]

  ===gotorixbathroom===
  As you enter the bathroom, you think about the events of tonight: you and Ben kissing at the Charles Bridge, {askbentodancewithyou: you two dancing together}. This night was perfect. After relieving yourself, you come out to see a stranger touching Ben inappropriately while Ben stares down uncomfortably. You approach them.
  LUKE: What's going on?
  BEN: He. He keeps touching me. Tried telling him to stop. 
  He stops talking. It looks likes he's shut down.
  LUKE: Stop touching him.
  MAN: Why? He's clearly not asking me to stop.
  LUKE: Can't you see how uncomfortable he is? Get off him now.
  He lets go of Ben and approaches you.

  BEN: Dance? Like in slow dance?
  LUKE: Yes.
  You hold out your hand for Ben to take.
  BEN: Uh, okay.
  He takes your hand and you lead him to the dance floor. You put your hands on his shoulders and he slowly puts his hands on your waist. Together, you dance to the music.
  BEN: This is nice.
  LUKE: Yeah it is. I'm glad I asked you to come here.
  BEN: Yeah. Me too.
  *[Kiss him]
  ->kissbenondancefloor
  ===kissbenondancefloor===
  You sweep him in for a nice long kiss. With the slow music playing in the background, it feels like a magical movie moment. Or it would feel like one if you didn't have a sudden urge to go to the toilet. You let go of him.
  LUKE: I need to go to the toilet.
  BEN: Okay.
  As you enter the bathroom, you think about the events of tonight: you and Ben kissing at the Charles Bridge, you two dancing at a club. This night was perfect.

 He trys to punch you but you dodge it. You then push him to the ground. He looks up at you in horror and runs out of the club.
 LUKE: Are you okay Ben?
 He pulls out his phone and starts typing. A moment later, he gives his phone to you. There's an alert that says: I can't use or process speech right now but I can handle text communication. 
 You pull out your phone and text him if he wants to go back to the hotel. A few seconds later, he replies.
 BEN: Yes. I do.
 You escort him out of the club in silence.

  You poke him in his stomach which makes him giggle. He grabs your hands to prevent any further tickling.

  LUKE: Can you please remind me when I need to take my medication?
  BEN: Yeah. I can try and do that. I have to warn you though, my executive dysfunction isn't really that great some days. It's why I had to set up an app on my phone that helps with it. Doesn't your planner help you?
  LUKE: Yeah but sometimes I forget the planner exists. Having you remind me would be a really big help.
