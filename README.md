# The Distracted Spy (Ink Version)
An interactive fiction game written in Inkle Studio's markup language [ink](https://github.com/inkle/ink), used to make games such as 80 Days and Heaven's Vault. 
## Plot
The plot of the game is about a MI6 agent named Luke Stone who has to go on a mission stop an enemy named Erik Georgiy from releasing secrets about MI5 and MI6. As you go on this mission, you discover secrets that will change your life forever. 
## Status of game
Two chapters have been written and published online. Currently, the third chapter is being written with all of the different narrative branches. I plan to have 4 chapters in total. Depending on my schedule, I may create a Unity version of the game. 
## Where to play the game
You can currently play the game on [my itch.io page](https://toyinariyo.itch.io/the-distracted-spy-ink).
